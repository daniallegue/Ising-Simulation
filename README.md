# Ising-Simulation
This code simulates the Ising model, a mathematical model in statistical mechanics used to study ferromagnetism. The Metropolis algorithm is employed to simulate the evolution of the system, with an option for simulated annealing to enhance exploration.

Ising Model
The Ising model represents a lattice of magnetic spins, typically aligned up or down. The energy of the system is determined by the interactions between neighboring spins. The Metropolis (a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) algorithm probabilistically updates the spin configuration to explore different energy states.
